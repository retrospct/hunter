## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Multi-Company Job Monitor team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Multi-Company Job Monitor, please report it to us privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

Please email us at [INSERT SECURITY CONTACT EMAIL HERE].

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggestions for a fix (optional).

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress. We aim to address all valid reports as quickly as possible.

Once a vulnerability is fixed, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure, if appropriate. We may also list your name in our acknowledgments if you agree.

Thank you for helping keep Multi-Company Job Monitor secure.
